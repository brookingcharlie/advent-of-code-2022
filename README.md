# Advent of Code 2022

My solutions for [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022/).

Advent of Code is a series of small programming puzzles - one per day throughout
1-25 of December - that can be solved in any programming language.

I chose to learn a bit more Python.

To run the main code or unit tests for each day, use these Docker-based scripts:

```
./main.sh <day>
./test.sh <day>
```

For example:

```
% ./main.sh 1
66616
199172

% ./test.sh 1
....
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 4 tests in 0.000s

OK
```
